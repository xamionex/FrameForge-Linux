# FrameForge — Warframe Companion `v1.4.0`

A desktop companion for Warframe that shows your live inventory, tracks crafting recipes, displays market prices, runs a full trading desk, manages a live timer dashboard, and auto-detects relic reward screens — all without modifying the game.

> **Windows only** — requires Windows 10 or 11. Inventory scanning requires Warframe to be running; all other features work standalone.

---

## Features

### Live Inventory Scanning
Your inventory is read directly from the Warframe process memory every 10 seconds across 13 item categories — resources, mods, arcanes, relics, weapons, Warframes, companions, and more. No login required. The scanner is **strictly read-only**: it uses `ReadProcessMemory`, the same Windows API used by Overwolf and hardware monitors. It never writes to memory, injects code, or modifies the game.

A quantity change log records every item gain and loss with timestamps.

### Foundry — Recipe Browser & Tracker
Browse every craftable item with full ingredient trees. Each component is colour-coded by status (owned, blueprint only, missing) and shows which relics drop it. Star items to **track** them in the Modular Window, which shows a per-item breakdown of exactly what you still need to farm.

### Market Helper — Prime Sets
Browse every Prime set with live platinum prices from [warframe.market](https://warframe.market). Shows total set value, per-part pricing, ducat values, and your ownership status. Click any set card or individual part to open a **live order popup** showing:
- Current sell and buy orders sorted by price
- 3-week price history chart
- One-click listing from directly inside the popup (requires WFM login)

### Trading (warframe.market)
Log in to your warframe.market account to access full trading features:
- **Active listings** — view, edit price/quantity, and delete your buy and sell orders
- **Post listings** — list any item directly from the Prime Sets view or from the order popup
- **Trade whispers** — incoming warframe.market trade offers captured live from your game's chat log and displayed with one-click invite and sold responses
- **Online status** — set your WFM status to Online, In Game, or Invisible via WebSocket
- Session token is stored securely in **Windows Credential Manager** — your password is never saved

### Relic Helper
Browse void fissure drop tables with rarity colour-coding (Bronze/Silver/Gold), ownership status, and platinum value. Supports all refinement levels: Intact, Exceptional, Flawless, Radiant.

### Timers
A live dashboard fetching data directly from DE's official Warframe worldstate:

- **World Cycles** — Cetus (Day/Night), Orb Vallis (Warm/Cold), Cambion Drift, Zariman with countdown to next change
- **Bounties** — reset timers per open world (Cetus, Orb Vallis, Cambion Drift, Zariman, Hex)
- **Daily & Weekly** — Daily Reset, Weekly Reset, Sortie (expandable with missions), Archon Hunt, The Circuit (frame/weapon picks), Deep Archimedea, Kahl/Break Narmer
- **Events** — Baro Ki'Teer with expandable inventory (Ducat/Credit prices + Owned badges), Prime Resurgence with expandable inventory (Aya prices + Owned badges), Nightwave, Darvo daily deal, active community events
- **Alerts** — mission type, faction, reward, countdown
- **Invasions** — attacker/defender factions, progress bar, rewards
- **Void Fissures** — Normal, Steel Path, and Void Storm tabs as a grid of tiles. Watched fissures highlighted in blue.
- **Fissure Watches** — configure Mode + Tier + Mission Type filters; matching fissures are highlighted in the fissure list and auto-surfaced in the Modular Window

Any timer can be pinned to the Modular Window for at-a-glance viewing.

### Statistics — Trade Tracker & Reports
A full trade history and analytics dashboard, automatically populated from your activity:

**Trades tab:**
- Every in-game trade is detected automatically from `EE.log` the moment "The trade was successful!" appears — no button to press
- WFM trades are logged automatically when you click **✓ Sold** in the Messages tab
- Manual entry form for trades made outside of FrameForge
- Each trade records: item name (with mod rank e.g. `Ammo Case (R0)`), quantity, platinum, trading partner, direction, source, and timestamp

**Reports tab:**
- Date range filter: Today / 7 Days / 30 Days / 90 Days / YTD / 1 Year / All Time
- KPI cards: total earned, total spent, net profit, average per trade
- **Cumulative platinum chart** — running net profit over time
- **Daily bar chart** — green bars on days you earned, red bars on days you spent
- **Items breakdown table** — every item with # sold, # bought, average sell price, and net platinum; sorted by most profitable
- **Top trading partners** — top 10 players by total platinum exchanged

### OCR Relic Reward Overlay
When a void fissure reward screen opens in-game, FrameForge automatically captures and reads all four reward cards using Windows OCR and displays a transparent overlay with each item's platinum price, ducat value, and set completion — so you can pick the best reward instantly without alt-tabbing. Priority mode is configurable: Item Completion, Most Set Value, Most Plat, or Most Ducats.

### Modular Window
A customisable sidebar (or detachable floating window) with four reorderable sections:
- **Tracking** — items being crafted with per-item ingredient requirements and collapse toggles
- **Favorites** — watched inventory items with live quantities
- **Timers** — pinned countdowns from the Timers tab
- **Watched Fissures** — live fissures matching your configured watches

## Is This Safe?

| | What FrameForge does |
|---|---|
| **Memory access** | Read-only via `ReadProcessMemory` — never writes, never injects, never hooks |
| **Game modification** | Nothing. No DLL injection, no code hooking, no writing to memory |
| **Network requests** | `warframe.market` (prices + trading), DE worldstate API (timers), WFCD community GitHub repos (item catalog, drop rates, localisation), Warframe CDN (item images). No FrameForge server. No telemetry. |
| **Your account** | WFM login uses the official v1 auth endpoint. Session token stored in Windows Credential Manager — never in a FrameForge file. Warframe Companion API credentials are read from game memory and never written to disk. |
| **Your data** | Nothing leaves your machine except the network calls listed above |

**Don't take our word for it** — the full source code is in this repository under GPLv3. You can read every line, build it yourself, and verify exactly what it does.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/) installed for inventory scanning (Foundry, Market, Relics, and Timers work without it)
- A [warframe.market](https://warframe.market) account for trading features (optional)
- The OCR overlay works best in Windowed or Borderless Windowed mode; Fullscreen Exclusive also supported via DXGI capture

---

## Installation

1. Go to [**Releases**](../../releases) and download the latest installer
2. Run it — Windows SmartScreen may warn you because the binary is not yet code-signed; click **More info → Run anyway**
3. Launch FrameForge from the Start menu or desktop shortcut

> The SmartScreen warning appears because code-signing certificates cost ~$300/year. The source code is fully public for independent verification.

## How It Works — Technical Overview

### Memory Scanning (`memory_scanner.rs`)
FrameForge enumerates committed, readable memory regions of the Warframe process using `VirtualQueryEx` and reads them with `ReadProcessMemory`. Three independent pattern matchers run over each region:
- **Resource scanner** — stackable items via JSON patterns like `"ItemCount":N,"ItemType":"/Lotus/..."`
- **Unique scanner** — weapons, Warframes, and companions via Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching
- **Pending recipe scanner** — active Foundry jobs via ISO-8601 completion timestamps

A **stability buffer** requires a quantity to appear in two consecutive scans before it is committed. Only `MEM_COMMIT` regions with readable page protection are scanned; regions larger than 128 MB are skipped.

### Timers (`lib.rs`)
Worldstate data is fetched from `api.warframe.com/cdn/worldState.php`, parsed in Rust into a structured format, and served to the frontend via Tauri IPC. Node names are resolved from the WFCD sol nodes dataset. Event names are resolved from the WFCD localisation dataset.

### Trading (`lib.rs`)
WFM order management uses the v2 REST API (`api.warframe.market/v2/`). Authentication uses the v1 signin endpoint (returns a session token via `set-cookie`). Online status is set via WebSocket (`wss://ws.warframe.market/socket`) using the `@wfm|cmd/status/set` command with a 6-hour duration.

### OCR Overlay (`ocr.rs`)
1. `EE.log` is monitored for `openvoidprojectionrewardscreen`
2. After a 350 ms delay, the top 48% of the Warframe window is captured via `PrintWindow` (GDI) or DXGI Desktop Duplication
3. Windows WinRT OCR extracts text from the capture
4. Rarity bar colour analysis classifies each of the 4 reward slots
5. Fuzzy string matching maps OCR output to catalog item names
6. A transparent overlay displays each card's item name, price, ducat value, and set completion

### Item Data (`wfcd.rs`)
Item and recipe data is fetched on first launch and cached to disk:

| Source | Used for |
|---|---|
| [warframe-items (WFCD)](https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-items) | Item catalog, categories, ducat values, vaulted status |
| [warframe-public-export-plus](https://github.com/calamity-inc/warframe-public-export-plus) | Authoritative recipe trees (LZMA-compressed) |
| [Warframe Wiki Module:Void](https://wiki.warframe.com) | Canonical relic reward display names |

## Data & Privacy

- **No account required** for inventory scanning, Foundry, Market Helper, Relic Helper, or Timers
- **No telemetry** — FrameForge has no server and makes no analytics calls
- **Local storage only** — a SQLite database of your quantity changes and trade history at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\warframe-companion\`
- **WFM session token** — stored in Windows Credential Manager if "Stay logged in" is enabled; your password is never saved
- **Warframe.market requests** are made from your machine directly to warframe.market (same as visiting in a browser)
